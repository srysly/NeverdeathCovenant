# Session 1 Summary

The group is apprehended by Neverwinter guards after Azrael mysteriously disappears (later revealed he slipped while rappelling and encountered a halfling named Tavian "Ghost" Dreymoor who offered him a hideout and potential Zhentarim connection). While the group is questioned about a severed hand and symbol found at a massacre scene, Azrael explores Tavian's hideout, discovers blueprints for Castle Never, and disguises himself.

The guards task the group with finding the hooded man responsible for the massacre or providing proof of what happened before dawn in exchange for 500 gold each. Kaelen, tasked with identifying a magical eyeball found with the hand, learns it points southward when a specific phrase is spoken. The group, now including the disguised Azrael, follows the eyeball's direction to a ruined section of the city.

They discover a hidden tunnel, leading to a sarcophagus bearing the Hallwinter family sigil. They encounter a lost ghost who seems connected to the Hallwinter name. Continuing on, they find a desecrated shrine to Augma and are attacked by undead. After defeating them, the eyeball glows brighter, indicating they are on the right track.
