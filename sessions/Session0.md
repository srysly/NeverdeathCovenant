We start in a tavern, Driftwood tavern.  We are there to listen to the two best performers in all of Neverwinter (Roc and the Rollers, and The Embersiren).
Exterior built from worn patchwork planks.  Been around a long time.  Sign made out of Driftwood.  Stage right.

ROLL FOR INTIATIVE

Trey (Azrael) walks into the Bar.  He tries to make his way to the bar.  He spots one open table with coincidental 4 open seats.  He orders some drank and foods. The bartender has a smooth and warm voice.  He orders roasted pork, taters, and carrots and goes to sit down.  Gets free food as welcome to Neverwinter.  Rosene, most folks call her madame.

Gary (Ramus) sticks his head in the inn, looking for Orcs or Goblins.  Sees a few half-orcs.  Approaches the bar.  Pushes past some folks jockying for position.  Gets the same welcome spiel.  Orders purple drank (ale c) and some stew.  Gary asks her about a potential gang heading to Neverwinter.  Says he came here due to the large crowd.  Nothing outside of the normal street gang.  The Beast Tamer alliance is who he is looking for.  He is directed over to Azraels table, and he sees, a man, sitting, wearing worn fabric clothing and a dark grey wool cloak.  Has long white dreads down his back, but his face is obscured by dark mask.

They introduce themselves to eachother, and they kiss j/k.

Ramus is a 5ft tall blue tortle.  He has green dots, with yellow singeing up his hands.

Brody (Gregor) goes in, sees the same shit.  Making his way down town, walking fast, and now hes bar bound.  Gets beer spilled on him by some idiot.  Idiot gets escorted out by a bugbear named Curtis.

Gregor is a human, with a glint of something otherworldly from his eyes.  Wearing a robe with a hood pulled down over his face.  Darkened skin tone, as if he has been travelling a while under the sun.

Kaelen walks in, owns the place, invents Ale-Tea, and gets his whole tab covered.  

Room is packed, even more people have come in.  Curtis cleared more room by removing tables.

The Embersiren is a Crimson skinned Tiefling.  The Embersiren locks eyes with Azrael, and its no accident.  She maintains eye contact, and before looking away, she winks.

Shits wild, the lyrics dont match what we know the song to be.  The crowd is loving everything about this, the band is completely jamming out.  The song ends, but there is a lingering sense of wrongness in the air.  The MC asks for cheers for the Embersiren.

Roc and the Rollers comes out, They are Dwarves in tight leather pants and glittering vests.
