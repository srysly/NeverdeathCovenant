# Session 2

We hear a scream come from the bottom hallway.  Confirmed that the eye is still pointing in the same direction.  

Ramus heads down the hallway and comes across the following:

>A double door made of green-tinged stone seals off further progression into the catacombs. Facing the double door is a large carving of a grinning skull; one eye socket bears a wide eyeball with a jeweled iris, while the other is an empty divot.

Kaelen places the eyeball in the socket, it pulses with green light and the door opens.  Behind the door is a hallway leading down.  Ramus hears a bassy, deep rythmic humming coming from down the stairs.  The group decides to descent the stairs.  Kaelen takes the eye back out of the door before heading downstairs.

>The bottom of the stairway opens into a wide sanctuary with a vaulted ceiling. Stone pews are arranged in orderly rows. Black candles burning green flames occupy niches along the walls. Atop a pulpit at the far end of the hall stands a jagged sculpture of an emaciated hand with one eyeball in its palm.

We investigate the sculpture and dont find anything wild about it.  We decide to head down the right hallway, where we find another room, with bookshelves and notes.  Gregor checks the notes and it seems to be recalling the history of neverwinter, a childrens tale, lyrics to a song, and other random writings.  Kaelen pockets the scroll with the lyrics.  Kaelen determines that these documents may be written in code.  

Not sure what the code is, but after 10 - 15 minutes of studying, he makes out that its some kind of letter cipher.  Its based on the lyrics, and I am able to figure out letters in another text and come up with the name **ZALRYR**.  Between multiple texts, Kaelen discerns that these are **ZALRYR**s notes where he is trying to siphon secrets from and individual sole.  He has a logbook and over the last 6 months, the earlier experiments turned the subjects into sludge. Found another document referencing other cells of cultists.  They are sharing tips between them.  They are making incremental progress, and the latest attempt seems to have been successful.  Notes reference multiple prominent Sword Coast cities.

The loud humming is getting louder and coming from the hallway to the south.  Ramus and Azrael head down the hallway and discover a heavy stone door.  The two attempt to open the door but are STRUGGLING.

>Ben provide text.

ROLL FOR INITIATIVE 

I find a map of the sword coast, there are two marks on the maps (an eight pointed star east of icewind dale, and a scribbled note in margins, beneath the ice, the final will stir soon).  I see no ciphers on the map.

Ramus picks up the corpse of the hooded man.  Kaelen heads back into the chamber and sees that the star was made or drawn from ash.  Azrael takes some as evidence.  Kaelen feels lingering magic from the star.

We make out way out of the tunnels.  Azrael disguises himself and heads to the docks to meet the group after dealing with the guards.

The rest of the party make their way over to the Guard station.  Ramus dumps the body on the desk of the Captain.  Turns out the masked man WAS ZALRYR Blackthorne.  The man we were sent to find, the one missing the hand was one of the nothics.  Kaelen shares all the information with him including the sealed note found by Azrael.

>INSERT SEALED LETTER TEXT

The captain begins questioning the group about how the cult knows about our party.
