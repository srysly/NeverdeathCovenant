# Session 0 Summary

The group (Azrael, Ramus, Gregor, and Kaelen) meets in the Driftwood Tavern in Neverwinter to see Roc and the Rollers and The Embersiren perform.  Azrael arrives first, orders food and drink, and is welcomed to Neverwinter. Ramus enters, seeking information about the Beast Tamer alliance, and is directed to Azrael's table. They introduce themselves. Gregor arrives, has beer spilled on him, and witnesses an unruly patron being ejected. Kaelen, seemingly a local of some importance, arrives and has his tab covered.  The tavern becomes increasingly crowded. The Embersiren, a crimson-skinned Tiefling, makes deliberate eye contact with Azrael and winks. During her performance, the lyrics don't match the song, creating a sense of unease.  Roc and the Rollers, a group of dwarves, then take the stage.
